# KC Tenants Tech Team HW Assignment #1
## Spring 2025 Training Session

### Description
This project is my personal implementation of homework #1 for our (KCTenants) internal training on Python.

In order to test this, you will need the test inputs found in the Tech Team shared drive (inputs, outputs, and key directories)

This implementation currently (24 Mar 2025 17:10) fails the unit tests, as I implemented it all as one script, rather than writing the translate_data function. 

It does, however, pass the system test and outputs the correct file given the test input.
