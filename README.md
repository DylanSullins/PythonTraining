# KC Tenants Tech Team HW Assignment #1
## Spring 2025 Training Session

### Description
This project is my personal implementation of homework #1 for our (KCTenants) internal training on Python.

In order to test this, you will need the test inputs found in the Tech Team shared drive (inputs, outputs, and key directories)

This implementation currently (22 May 2025 18:09) does not pass tests. It passed the old tests, but not the new tests. Will update.
